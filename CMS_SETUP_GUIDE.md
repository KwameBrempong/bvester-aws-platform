3. Add/update field: `role: "admin"` or `role: "super_admin"`

Add this temporary code to your user profile to grant yourself admin access:
```javascript
// In ProfileScreen.js, add a temporary button:
<TouchableOpacity onPress={() => {
  userService.updateUserProfile(user.uid, { role: 'admin' });
  Alert.alert('Success', 'Admin role granted!');
}}>
  <Text>Grant Admin Access</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### 2. Access CMS Dashboard
Once you have admin role:
