# Bvester Stabilized Development Process

## üéØ Overview

This document outlines the stabilized development and deployment process for Bvester web application to prevent future breakages and ensure reliable releases.

## üèóÔ∏è Development Environments

### 1. **Development** (Local)
- **Purpose**: Active development and initial testing
- **Location**: Local machine (`http://localhost:8000`)
- **Use**: Make all code changes here first

### 2. **Staging** (Pre-Production)
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing and validation
- **Location**: AWS S3 Static Website
- **URL**: `http://bvester-staging.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com`
- **Use**: Test all changes before production deployment

### 3. **Production** (Live)
- **Purpose**: Live user-facing application
- **Location**: AWS S3 + CloudFront CDN
- **URL**: `https://bvester.com`
- **Use**: Serves real users

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Development
1. **Make Changes Locally**
   ```bash
   # Work on your local files
   # Test with local server if needed
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
   ```

### Phase 2: Staging Testing
1. **Deploy to Staging**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   deploy-staging.bat

   # Linux/Mac
   ./deploy-staging.sh
   ```

2. **Test Staging Environment**
   - Visit: `http://bvester-staging.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com`
   - Check all navigation buttons work
   - Verify mobile responsiveness
   - Test all user flows
   - Run automated tests:
   ```bash
   ./test-all-pages.sh staging
   ```

### Phase 3: Production Deployment
1. **Deploy to Production** (Only after staging approval)
   ```bash
   # Windows
   deploy-production.bat

   # Linux/Mac
   ./deploy-production.sh
   ```

2. **Verify Production**
   ```bash
   # Test production URLs
   curl -I https://bvester.com
   curl -I https://bvester.com/login-final.html
   curl -I https://bvester.com/signup-final.html
   curl -I https://bvester.com/investment-assessment.html
   ```

## üìã Deployment Checklist

Before EVERY deployment, ensure:

### Pre-Deployment ‚úÖ
- [ ] Code tested locally
- [ ] Changes committed to git
- [ ] No sensitive data in code
- [ ] Staging deployment successful
- [ ] All buttons functional in staging
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] No JavaScript console errors

### Post-Deployment ‚úÖ
- [ ] Production URLs return 200 status
- [ ] Homepage navigation working
- [ ] All critical user flows tested
- [ ] CloudFront cache invalidated
- [ ] No error reports from users

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### If Production is Broken:
1. **Immediate Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   emergency-rollback.bat

   # Linux/Mac
   ./emergency-rollback.sh
   ```

2. **Investigate and Fix**
   - Identify what went wrong
   - Fix the issue in development
   - Test thoroughly in staging
   - Deploy the fix using normal process

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Rules

### ‚ùå NEVER DO:
- Deploy directly to production without staging test
- Deploy during peak business hours without approval
- Deploy multiple unrelated changes at once
- Commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Skip the deployment checklist
- Deploy without a rollback plan

### ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO:
- Test in staging first
- Follow the deployment checklist
- Verify all button functionality
- Check mobile responsiveness
- Have emergency rollback ready
- Monitor production after deployment

## üîß Available Scripts

### Deployment Scripts
- `deploy-staging.bat/.sh` - Deploy to staging environment
- `deploy-production.bat/.sh` - Deploy to production environment
- `emergency-rollback.bat/.sh` - Emergency rollback to staging version

### Testing Scripts
- `test-all-pages.sh` - Automated testing of critical user flows
- Test both staging and production environments

### Manual Testing Commands
```bash
# Test staging
curl -I http://bvester-staging.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com

# Test production
curl -I https://bvester.com
curl -I https://bvester.com/login-final.html
curl -I https://bvester.com/signup-final.html
curl -I https://bvester.com/investment-assessment.html
```

## üìä Quality Gates

### Staging Quality Gate
Before production deployment, staging must:
- Return HTTP 200 for all pages
- Have functional button navigation
- Pass all automated tests
- Work correctly on mobile devices
- Have no JavaScript console errors

### Production Quality Gate
After production deployment, verify:
- All URLs accessible (HTTP 200)
- Homepage buttons redirect correctly
- User registration/login flows work
- Investment assessment accessible
- CloudFront cache properly invalidated

## üîç Monitoring

### Daily Monitoring
- Check https://bvester.com loads correctly
