## üîß DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS

### Before Making Changes:
1. **Scope Validation**: Confirm changes are within backend boundaries
2. **API Documentation**: Update API docs for any endpoint changes
3. **Data Schema**: Document any DynamoDB schema modifications
4. **Testing Plan**: Define unit and integration tests
5. **Performance Impact**: Consider Lambda cold start and DynamoDB costs

### During Development:
1. **One Service at a Time**: Focus on single Lambda function or service
2. **Test Locally**: Use SAM local or similar for testing
3. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling
4. **Logging**: Add structured logging for debugging
5. **Performance**: Monitor memory usage and execution time

### After Changes:
1. **Unit Tests**: All functions must have unit tests
2. **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints end-to-end
3. **Performance Tests**: Verify response times meet SLA
