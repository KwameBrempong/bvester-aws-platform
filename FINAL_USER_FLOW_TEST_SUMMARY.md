**Root Cause:** No JavaScript on homepage

#### What's Broken:
- 🔴 LOGIN button → **Does nothing** (should go to `/login-final.html`)

- 🔴 "GET INVESTMENT SCORE" button → **Does nothing** (should go to `/investment-assessment.html`)
- 🔴 "WATCH DEMO" button → **Does nothing** (should show demo)

#### User Impact:
- **100% of users cannot proceed past homepage**
- **Cannot access login, signup, or core features**

#### Fix Required:
Add 10 lines of JavaScript to `index.html`:
